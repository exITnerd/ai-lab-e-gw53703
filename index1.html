Many bakers use their cupcakes as a canvas for creativity, adding edible decorations like sprinkles, fresh fruits, or even miniature flowers. With the right tools and techniques, anyone can turn a cupcake into a beautiful masterpiece.</p>

            <h4>Innovative Flavors and Dietary Options</h4>
            <p>Cupcakes have evolved over the years, with new flavors and styles constantly emerging. Traditional flavors like chocolate and vanilla remain popular, but adventurous bakers are exploring more unique combinations such as lavender and honey or matcha green tea. Vegan and gluten-free options are also widely available, ensuring that everyone can enjoy a cupcake, regardless of dietary restrictions.</p>

            <h5>The Rich History of Cupcakes</h5>
